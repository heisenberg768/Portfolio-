        <h3>
            I developed a real-time inventory management system using C programming, focusing on data structures like
            linked lists and file handling for efficient data storage and retrieval. The project required debugging
            complex algorithms, optimizing code for performance, and integrating user-friendly features, showcasing my
            proficiency in C and problem-solving skills.

        <h3>
            Working on our final year project required seamless teamwork, where each member contributed their unique
            skills and perspectives. We divided responsibilities based on individual strengths, maintained open
            communication to address challenges, and regularly collaborated to ensure alignment with our goals. This
            approach not only enhanced the quality of our project but also fostered a productive and supportive team
            environment

        <h3>
            While working on an energy optimization project, I analyzed data patterns, identified inefficiencies, and
            devised innovative algorithms to reduce energy consumption. By questioning assumptions, exploring
            alternatives, and testing hypotheses, I implemented a cost-effective solution, demonstrating my critical
            thinking skills and ability to address complex problems with structured reasoning.
